                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Glaucoma is the term used to describe either the accumulated loss of retinal cells inside the
                    optic nerve or the gradual visual loss brought on by optic neuropathy. Glaucoma is a disease
                    that relates to the vision of the human eye. This disease is considered an irreversible disease
                    that results in vision deterioration. They don't have any early warning indications of this
                    glaucoma. We might not notice a change in your vision because the effect is so subtle. Many
                    deep learning (DL) models have been developed for the proper detection of glaucoma so far.
                    So, we present an architecture for proper glaucoma detection based on deep learning by
                    making use of the convolutional neural network (CNN). The differentiation between the
                    patterns formed for glaucoma and non-glaucoma can find out with the use of CNN. The CNN
                    provides a hierarchical structure of the images for differentiation. Utilizing the current
                    method, the sickness is detected. Whether a patient has glaucoma or not is determined by the
                    optic cup to the disc ratio. The diagnosis is enhanced by the integration of an image data
                    generator method of data augmentation. The outcomes demonstrate that the proposed model,
                    which outperformed many other existing algorithms, attained 98% accuracy. </p>
